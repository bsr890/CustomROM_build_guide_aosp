## Build Environment ##

Installing required packages

OS: Ubuntu 18.04 and higher

Version: 64-bit

```bash

sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison build-essential zip curl zlib1g-dev libc6-dev-i386 libncurses5 x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev lib32z1-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxml2-utils xsltproc unzip fontconfig

```
<br>

Setting Up Build Environment

```bash

sudo su

```


```bash

add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa && apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison build-essential zip curl zlib1g-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 libncurses5 lib32ncurses5-dev x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev lib32z1-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxml2-utils xsltproc unzip fontconfig && exit

```
<br>

Cloning Akhil Narang Scripts

```bash

mkdir ~/bin && PATH=~/bin:$PATH && cd ~/bin && curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo && chmod a+x ~/bin/repo && git clone https://github.com/akhilnarang/scripts.git scripts && cd scripts && bash setup/android_build_env.sh && cd

```
Directly Copy Paste these commands


## Device Tree ##

```bash
#Device tree contains

1. device_xiaomi_spes
2. kernel_xiaomi_spes
2. vendor_xiaomi_spes

spes is my device codename
It varies phone to phone

```

Cloning Pre merged Device Tree

```bash
mkdir rom_name
```

```bash
cd rom_name
```
<br>
Here,


-b stands for branch

13 stands for branch name and

device/xiaomi/spes for targeted path

```bash

git clone https://github.com/ProjectBlaze-Devices/device_xiaomi_spes.git -b 13 device/xiaomi/spes

```

```bash

git clone https://github.com/LineageOS/android_hardware_xiaomi.git -b lineage-20 hardware/xiaomi

```


Now navigate to this path ðŸ‘‡

```bash

cd device/xiaomi/spes

```

```bash

ls

```

<br>


## Bring Up ##

Now, you must have to modify these 2 files on device tree named

1. AndroidProducts.mk
2. blaze_spes.mk

Different rom use different code names likes

Pixel Experience use: aosp

LMODroid use: lmodroid

PixelOS use: aosp

Project Elixir use: aosp

it's available either on their GitHub manifest pages or in Telegram group

<br> <br>

Suppose, i am building LMODroid rn

So, my code name is lmodroid

It could be something else according to your Selected Rom

now, open AndroidProducts.mk using nano command

```bash

nano AndroidProducts.mk

```

Where you can see blaze, change it to lmodroid


Now, to save the AndroidProducts.mk press

"ctrl+o"

"enter"

"ctrl+x"

After pressing ctrl+x it will revert back to your current path.


Now, it's time to rename & modify the second files named blaze_spes.mk

For this particular rom, my codename is lmodroid

Now, type this to rename 

```bash

mv blaze_spes.mk lmodroid_spes.mk

```

Type

```bash

ls

```

To open "lmodroid_spes.mk", press

```bash

nano lmodroid_spes.mk

```


Change these things:

1. Inherit some common LineageOS stuff.
$(call inherit-product, vendor/blaze/config/common_full_phone.mk)

2. Product Specifics
PRODUCT_NAME := blaze_spes



It could be something else according to your device tree


Change 1: replace "blaze" with lmodroid

Change 2: replace blaze_spes to lmodroid_spes

I mean, in this two subsection replace the word "blaze" with "lmodroid"

Now, do the same procedure to save and exit as you did to save the AndroidProducts.mk


## Locate Rom Path ##

Now manually type ( cd .. ) to go on your rom directory, or paste this command below ðŸ‘‡

```bash

cd .. && cd .. && cd .. && ls

```

or this

```bash

cd .. && cd .. && cd ..

```

```bash

ls

```


That's it. Now, follow next step to start build the rom.


## Final Step to Build Rom ##

After paste this command the clang will be started to clone in your rom path

```bash

. build/envsetup.sh

```


If you want gapps build paste this;
If you want vanilla build skip this & directly follow the next step

```bash

exportWITH_GAPPS=true

```

```bash

lunch lmodroid_spes-userdebug

```


<b>Start compilation<b>

```bash

m bacon -jX

```

If it's not working for you then you can try these commands below ðŸ‘‡

```bash

make bacon

```

```bash

mka bacon -jX

```
